        "1.**Loss of Information and Reduced Statistical Power:** Deleting entire rows, even if only a small portion of data is missing, can significantly reduce the sample size. This leads to a loss of valuable information, decreases the statistical power of analyses, and can result in wider confidence intervals, making it harder to detect true effects or patterns.      \n",

The remaining data will no longer be representative of the original population, leading to biased parameter estimates and incorrect conclusions. For instance, if people with lower incomes are more likely to have missing income data, deleting those records would bias any analysis towards higher-income individuals.    \n",

        "\n",
        "* 1.**Robustness to Outliers**: Income data is often highly skewed, meaning there are a few very high-income individuals (outliers) that pull the average (mean) upwards. The mean is sensitive to these extreme values. The median, on the other hand, represents the middle value of a dataset when ordered and is not significantly affected by outliers.     \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* 2.**Preservation of Distribution**: When data is skewed, the mean may not accurately represent the 'typical' value. Using the mean to impute missing values in a skewed distribution can distort the true shape of the distribution, making it appear less skewed than it is. The median, being a measure of central tendency that is robust to skewness, tends to preserve the underlying distribution of the skewed variable more accurately.       \n",
        "* 3. **More Representative Value**: For skewed data, the median often provides a more representative 'typical' value than the mean. If you were to ask 'what is the typical income?', most people would likely think of a value closer to the median than the mean if the data is highly skewed. Imputing with a more representative value can lead to less biased downstream analyses and models."

A flag preserves this information, allowing downstream models or analyses to distinguish between originally present values and imputed values. This can reveal patterns in missingness that are predictive or insightful.\n",

        "3. **Preventing Bias Introduction**: If missingness is not completely random (Missing At Random - MAR, or Missing Not At Random - MNAR), simply imputing without a flag can mask this underlying bias. A flag allows models to account for potential systematic differences between observed and missing data, thereby reducing bias in parameter estimates and predictions.\n",

This insight can lead to rethinking whether income is truly necessary, how it's requested, or how the value proposition is communicated to address these concerns.\n",
